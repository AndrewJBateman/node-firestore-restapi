## :books: General info

* This app was created using Google Cloud App Engine and a Secure Shell (SSH) terminal with access to Cloud Storage to store book data and a storage bucket for images. The code was copied into this Github repo but requires Google authentication to be able to run it from Visual Studio.

## :camera: Screenshots

![Example screenshot](./img/app-engine.png).

## :signal_strength: Technologies

* [Express v4](https://expressjs.com/) Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
* [Multer v1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to handle multipart/form-data for uploading files.
* [Cloud Firestore: Node.js Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/firestore) Node.js Server SDK for Google Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL document database.
* [google-cloud/storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/storage) client for Google Cloud.
* [pug v3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) template engine for Node.js

## :floppy_disk: Setup

* Add Google Cloud credentials then run `npm run start` or `node server.js` for a dev server (this has not been tested).
* Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` or port 8080 for home screen.
* The app will not automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## :computer: Code Examples

* extract from `books/api.js` to retrieve a page of books (up to ten at a time).

```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  const {books, nextPageToken} = await db.list(10, req.query.pageToken);
  res.json({
    items: books,
    nextPageToken,
  });
});
```

## :cool: Features

* This was all run in Google Cloud using an SSH terminal, following Google tutorial instructions and it worked first time
* Pug makes it easier both to write reusable HTML and to render data from the books API

## :clipboard: Status & To-Do List

* Status: Working in the cloud
* To-Do: nothing, this is just to study and comment Google-supplied code to learn best practises
